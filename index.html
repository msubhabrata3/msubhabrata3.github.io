                        Hello! I'm a software engineer with a passion for photography and videography. 
                        <br>When I'm not immersed in the world of coding, you can find me capturing moments through the lens.
                        <br>I am also a part-time chef at my kitchen. My love for visual storytelling extends to my interest in cooking, 
                        where I experiment with flavors and create culinary delights.
                        <br>But if I had chosen a different career path and not become a software developer, I can envision myself 
                        embracing the world of stand-up comedy.
                        <br>Comedy provides a unique avenue for self-expression, and I believe the joy of making people laugh is a 
                        fulfilling alternative to the technical challenges of software development. 
                        <br>The ability to craft jokes, observe the lighter side of life, and share those moments with others is a 
                        compelling alternative profession that I would have explored with enthusiasm.
                        <br>Balancing the technical intricacies of software development with the creativity of visual arts and the joy of 
                        making people laugh, I lead a diverse and fulfilling life.
                        <br><br>Please feel free to check my work.
